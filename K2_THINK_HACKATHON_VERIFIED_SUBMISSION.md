## PART A: ONE-PAGER

### Section 1: Problem & User (196 words)

**Target Users:** Open-source maintainers, enterprise development teams, and GitHub repository owners managing multiple codebases with accumulated technical debt and unresolved issues.

**Pain Points:** GitHub hosts millions of repositories with countless open issues. Major organizations like Microsoft have thousands of unresolved issues across their public repositories. Development teams spend significant time on repetitive tasks: bug fixes, code reviews, and implementing straightforward feature requests. Current AI coding assistants primarily help write code snippets—they don't autonomously handle the complete lifecycle from issue analysis to pull request submission.

**Importance:** The software industry invests billions annually in maintenance tasks. Small open-source projects struggle with maintainer burnout from handling routine issues. Enterprises pay premium rates for developers to address simple bugs that could be automated. A large percentage of "help wanted" labeled issues remain unresolved for extended periods.

**Urgency:** With AI-generated code proliferating, repositories grow faster than human capacity to maintain them. The gap between issue creation and resolution widens continuously. Organizations need autonomous systems capable of understanding requirements, implementing solutions, and submitting production-ready code at scale.

### Section 2: What You'll Build (199 words)

**Core Offering:** We're integrating K2 Think's ultra-fast reasoning model (2,000 tokens/sec) into Hive Mind, an existing open-source autonomous development platform (npm: @deep-assistant/hive-mind). The integration will dramatically increase processing speed and enable more concurrent AI agents than the current default of 2 workers.

**User Flow:**
1. User provides GitHub repository URL via command line or Telegram bot
2. System scans for open issues with specified labels (configurable)
3. K2-powered agents analyze issues in parallel
4. Each agent autonomously: creates branch → generates solution → opens pull request
5. Human maintainers review and merge the submitted PRs

**Platform:** Node.js application integrating K2 Think alongside existing Claude (Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.1, Haiku 4.5) and OpenCode (GPT-4o, Grok) model support. Uses GitHub GraphQL API for batch operations. Includes Telegram bot interface (@hive_mind_pull_requests channel exists for demos).

**Additional Highlights:**
- Supports automatic repository forking for contributions without write access
- Session management for resuming interrupted work
- Configurable concurrency (currently defaults to 2 parallel workers)
- Remote command execution via Telegram groups
- Published NPM package for easy installation

### Section 3: Why K2 Think (60 words)

We're leveraging K2 Think's 2,000 tokens/second processing capability—significantly faster than current supported models. This speed enables scaling beyond the current 2-worker default to potentially dozens of parallel agents. K2's superior mathematical reasoning will enhance algorithm analysis, performance optimization, and solution verification—adding capabilities beyond what current Claude/OpenCode integrations provide in the existing Hive Mind platform.

### Section 4: Demo (49 words)

In 48 hours, we'll demonstrate K2-enhanced Hive Mind solving multiple real GitHub issues simultaneously. The demo will show the existing platform's capabilities—automated branch creation, code generation, and PR submission—now accelerated by K2's processing speed. Live monitoring via the Telegram bot will display parallel agents working at unprecedented velocity.

### Section 5: Support Needed (28 words)

We need K2 Think API access with sufficient rate limits for parallel execution, CLI integration documentation, and technical guidance for optimizing concurrent model instances within our Node.js architecture.
